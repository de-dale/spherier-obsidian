Ancien SubStack de Kent Beck (avant TidyFirst)

1. People create incentive systems all the time, often without realizing it.
2. They do so mostly by copying, without thinking about the tradeoffs they are navigating.
3. Incentive system decisions made badly have wide-ranging consequences, especially for people with less power.
4. It's not rocket surgery to do a better job of creating incentive systems. Improvement starts with awareness & caring.
5. It's in everyone's best interest to improve.

Atelier suivi à NewCrafts 2023, animé par [[Diana MONTALION]]

> As technologists, we craft knowledge. We weave other people’s thinking and experiences into our own. We solve problems. We construct valuable recommendations and improve them through communication.
>
> We envision what is not yet visible and bring it to life.
> 
> We also get lost in the forest of disparate opinions. We go down promising paths and discover dead ends. When we do discover a viable path … almost nobody follows us .
> 
> We are sometimes screaming into the wind.
> 
> Constructing something whole and actionable from abstract ideas requires creating conceptual integrity. Unfortunately, we are truly terrible at creating or maintaining conceptual integrity … unless we are supported by practices.
> 
> Fortunately, writing is the practice of crafting conceptual integrity.
> 
> Writing practices can help us:  
> - strengthen metacognition: awareness of our own thought process.  
> - synthesize knowledge, experience and sound judgment into well-reasoned recommendations.  
> - learn.  
> - navigate uncertainty through inquiry.  
> - think well, together.
> 
> Thinking well together generates better outcomes. And makes daily life more enjoyable for everyone. When people cooperatively strengthen their thinking, and reasons for acting, they make better decisions.
> 
> When we structure teams and initiatives with high levels of conceptual integrity, where knowledge grows and people flourish, we are providing integrative leadership. This type of leadership is a strong foundation for generating true and lasting change.
> 
> In this hands-on lab, we will write. Together, we’ll try five writing practices that, when done regularly, improve our ability to think, learn and lead. Including timed free writing, systemic reasoning, modeling artifacts and structuring recommendations for varying audiences. Fair warning: it will be a lot of fun.
> 
> Bring your favorite pen.

# Notes

We are Knowledge workers

Trois chose qu'on va voir dans l'atelier
- Writing Practice and Cultivate
- Writing as a Method of Inquiry
- Design Feedback Loops

> The only thing in production, est what we talked about and what we thought about

> We can generate things from **our** brain not only others

Focused Wrintign :
- Like CODE
- Timer
- no distraction
- write
- 25-60mins

Daily Free Writing
- write by HAND
- Fill 3 pages / Timer / Cup of tea
- Consistency is key

Taking a break
	!= checkmails
	=> Do something for human

System reasonning is about consent

Claim -> Reasons (to support the claim) -> Infer Value (why does this matter in this circonstance today)

Strenghted the reason
-> in the wrinting process
-> 4 Practices
- RELIABLE
	- Justify / Verify
	- "Changfe my mind" <- Not systemic Reasonning
- REELEVANT
	- Has Weight ?
	- Connected ?
- STRONG
	- Well defined
	- Sufficient
- COHESIVE
	- Inference
	- Cogence (pas sur du mot => Si c'rst le bon mot == *sound and convincing* ) (comes from writing practice)
		- => You dont resolve doubts by thinking
		- Instead : create an experience

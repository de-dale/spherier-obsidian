## Card-based Discussions

**Use Case**
Use this when discussions about software design are not productive because:
‚Ä¢ some participants have difficulties to ex- press their thoughts 
‚Ä¢ the discussion itself lacks sound argumentation or 
‚Ä¢ a single developer dominates the discussion. 

**Preparation**
1) Start with reading the cards carefully and get familiar with the arguments. 
2) Start with the basic set ( ) and build a deck of not more than 20 cards. 
3) Each developer participating in the discussion should have an own deck. 
**Basic Rules**
1) When you play a card, explain how this argument is applied in the concrete situation. 
2) You may only play one card at a time. Then it's your colleague‚Äôs turn. Either use one card from your deck or the card your col- league has just played. 
3) You can also play a question or action card but also only one at a time.

## Dimensions
There are four dimensions: 
- simple vs. powerful (green) 
- abstract vs. concrete (blue) 
- pragmatic vs. idealistic (red) 
- robust vs. technologic (yellow)
Each dimension represents two contrary but related perspectives on design and each argument card provides a distinct aspect relevant from this perspective

- **simple** stands for simple solutions, no magic, nothing sophisticated but easy to read and maintain.
- **powerful** stands for foresighted solutions, ge- neric and flexible. 
- **abstract** stands for having the big picture in mind and keeping the bird‚Äôs eye view. 
- **concrete** stands for knowing the details, being able to breathe code likea fish can breathe water.
- **pragmatic** stands for creating value with a very customer-focused perspective. 
- **idealistic** stands for focusing on quality and professionalism, for avoiding dirty hacks and 80 percent solutions. 
- **robust** stands for stability and reduction of risks. 
- **technologic** stands for the potential new tech- nology offers.

## Guidelines for prompting

### Prompting Principles

- **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**
- **Principle 2: Give the model time to ‚Äúthink‚Äù**
### Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
=> clear != short
#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
Exemple : 
> prompt = f"""
> Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
> into a single sentence.
> ```{text}```
> """

#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output

- JSON, HTML

**Exemple :** 
  > prompt = f"""
  > Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
  > with their authors and genres. 
  > Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
  > book_id, title, author, genre.
  > """
#### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied
Faire des hypoth√®ses sur ce que peut faire le mod√®le avec les instruction qu'on lui donne, et lui demander de v√©rifier ces hypoth√®ses et de l'indiquer si les conditions ne sont pas v√©rifi√©es.

**Exemple :** 
> prompt = f"""
> You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
> If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
> re-write those instructions in the following format:
> 
> Step 1 - ...
> Step 2 - ‚Ä¶
> ‚Ä¶
> Step N - ‚Ä¶
> 
> If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
> then simply write \"No steps provided.\"
> 
> \"\"\"{text_2}\"\"\"
> """

#### Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting
> Give successful examples of completing tasks then ask model to perfrom the task

Donner au mod√®les des exemples de r√©solution de la tache, conformes √† l'atendu, puis lui demander d'ex√©cuter la t√¢che

Exemple :
> prompt = f"""
> Your task is to answer in a consistent style.
> 
> \<child>: Teach me about patience.
> 
> \<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
> valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
> grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
> the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.
> 
> \<child>: Teach me about resilience.
> """

### Principle 2: Give the model time to "think"

##### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task

Exemple : 
> prompt_1 = f"""
> Perform the following actions: 
> 1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple backticks with 1 sentence.
> 2 - Translate the summary into French.
> 3 - List each name in the French summary.
> 4 - Output a json object that contains the following keys: french_summary, num_names.
> 
> Separate your answers with line breaks.
> 
> Text:
> ```{text}```
> """

###### Ask for output in a specified format

> prompt_2 = f"""
> Your task is to perform the following actions: 
> 1 - Summarize the following text delimited by 
>   <> with 1 sentence.
> 2 - Translate the summary into French.
> 3 - List each name in the French summary.
> 4 - Output a json object that contains the 
  > following keys: french_summary, num_names.
> 
> Use the following format:
> Text: \<text to summarize>
> Summary: \<summary>
> Translation: \<summary translation>
> Names: \<list of names in Italian summary>
> Output JSON: \<json with summary and num_names>
> 
> Text: \<{text}>
> """

##### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

Exemple d'une t√¢che propos√©e "La solution est-elle correcte ?"
=> Le mod√®le peut se tromper et consid√©rer que oui, alors que non.

Solution: demenader au mod√®le de cosntuire sa solution et de la comparer 

Exemple : 
> prompt = f"""  
> Your task is to determine if the student's solution \  
> is correct or not.  
> To solve the problem do the following:  
> - First, work out your own solution to the problem.   
> - Then compare your solution to the student's solution \   
> and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not.   
> Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until   
> you have done the problem yourself.  
>   
> Use the following format:  
> Question:  
> ```  
> question here  
> ```  
> Student's solution:  
> ```  
> student's solution here  
> ```  
> Actual solution:  
> ```  
> steps to work out the solution and your solution here  
> ```  
> Is the student's solution the same as actual solution \  
> just calculated:  
> ```  
> yes or no  
> ```  
> Student grade:  
> ```  
> correct or incorrect  
> ```  
>   
> Question:  
> ```  
> I'm building a solar power installation and I need help \  
> working out the financials.   
> - Land costs $100 / square foot  
> - I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot  
> - I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \  
> me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \  
> foot  
> What is the total cost for the first year of operations \  
> as a function of the number of square feet.  
> ```   
> Student's solution:  
> ```  
> Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.  
> Costs:  
> 1. Land cost: 100x  
> 2. Solar panel cost: 250x  
> 3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x  
> Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000  
> ```  
> Actual solution:  
> """



## Iterative Prompt Develelopment

Bien penser que, entra√Æner un mod√®le, ne fonctionne presque jamais du premier coup !
Ce qui est important, c'est d'avoir en t√™te le process permettant de faire fonctionner les prompts qui fonctionnent pour notre cas, plut√¥t que d'avoir un prompt qui fonctionne du premier coup.

**Prompt guidelines**
- Be clear and specific
- Analyze why result does not give desired output
- Refine the idea and the prompt
- Repeat

**Iterative prompt**
- try something
- Analyse where the result case does not give what you want
- Clarify instructions, give more time to think
- Refine prompts with patch of examples

> good prompt **<** have a process for developping a good prompt

**Quand le prompt ne convient pas : il faut clarifier ce qu'on attend !**

Exemple du prompt qui ne convient pas :
> prompt = f"""  
> Your task is to help a marketing team create a   
> description for a retail website of a product based   
> on a technical fact sheet.  
>   
> Write a product description based on the information   
> provided in the technical specifications delimited by   
> triple backticks.  
>   
> Technical specifications: ```{fact_sheet_chair}```  
> """
#### Issue 1: The text is too long
- Limit the number of words/sentences/characters.

Exemple : 
> prompt = f"""  
> Your task is to help a marketing team create a   
> description for a retail website of a product based   
> on a technical fact sheet.  
>   
> Write a product description based on the information   
> provided in the technical specifications delimited by   
> triple backticks.  
> 
> **Use at most 50 words.** (ou : "*Use 2 sentences*", ou "*Use at most 280 characters*")
>   
> Technical specifications: ```{fact_sheet_chair}```  
> """

#### Issue 2. Text focuses on the wrong details
- Ask it to focus on the aspects that are relevant to the intended audience.

Exemple : 
> prompt = f"""  
> Your task is to help a marketing team create a   
> description for a retail website of a product based   
> on a technical fact sheet.  
>   
> Write a product description based on the information   
> provided in the technical specifications delimited by   
> triple backticks.  
>   
> **The description is intended for furniture retailers,   
> so should be technical in nature and focus on the   
> materials the product is constructed from.  
>**   
> Use at most 50 words.  
>   
> Technical specifications: ```{fact_sheet_chair}```  
> """

#### Issue 3. Description needs a table of dimensions
- Ask it to extract information and organize it in a table.

> prompt = f"""  
> Your task is to help a marketing team create a   
> description for a retail website of a product based   
> on a technical fact sheet.  
>   
> Write a product description based on the information   
> provided in the technical specifications delimited by   
> triple backticks.  
>   
> The description is intended for furniture retailers,   
> so should be technical in nature and focus on the   
> materials the product is constructed from.  
>   
> At the end of the description, include every 7-character   
> Product ID in the technical specification.  
>   
> After the description, include a table that gives the   
> product's dimensions. The table should have two columns.  
> In the first column include the name of the dimension.   
> In the second column include the measurements in inches only.  
>   
> Give the table the title 'Product Dimensions'.  
>   
> Format everything as HTML that can be used in a website.   
> Place the description in a \<div> element.  
>   
> Technical specifications: ```{fact_sheet_chair}```  
> """

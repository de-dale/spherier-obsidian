# Template Notions

> A personal ReadMe (or user manual) is a document that individuals, often leaders or team members in a business setting, created to help others understand how they work. It's a tool for accelerating the process of "getting to know you" between colleagues or within teams.
### Getting Personal

- **🎖️ What do I value in life**
  List the qualities and traits you strive for and admire in others
- **😁 What Brings Out my Best**
  Think back to a time you were at your best. What enabled you?
- **😡 What Frustrates Me**
  Tell us the things or actions that drive you nuts. Don’t hold back
### My Toolbox

- **💪 My Strengths - Let's use them**
  Blow your own trumpet. Tell us the things you rock at and what the team should come to you for.
- **👀 My Blind Spots**
  We all have them. Tell us about the things you’re working on improving
- **😕 Misunderstandings about me**
  Provide clarity on the things that people often misunderstand about you.
### Working Together
- **🖥️ How I like to work**
  Under what conditions do you create your best work? Are you a night owl or and early bird? Solo worker or team thinker.
- **✍️ How to communicate with me**
  How do you like being communicated with? What’s the best way to give feedback?
- 💩 When shit hits the fan
  How do you react to stress? How can the team support you in these times?

> “Code is self documenting”
> 
> Maybe, let’s just say it is and look one step past that.
> 
> It totally avoids the actual issue. “Self documenting” code only documents what it _does_, not what it’s _supposed to do_. The longer you’re around, the more you’ll appreciate the difference.
> 
> The notion of "self documenting code" /does/ include comments, which should be talking about both the "why" and about intent. If the architecture is domain-driven, the domain provides the big-picture as well. You need very little beyond that unless the system is very large.

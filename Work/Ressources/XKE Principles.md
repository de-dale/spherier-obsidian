The XKE is one of the primary investments in the Xebia matra: "Knowledge is to be shared". To ensure knowledge flows freely throughout the organization and across business units, the following principles apply.

1. **The XKE exists for Xebians, supported by Xebians**

- You share your knowledge with others.
- You actively take part in sessions.
- You determine the content of the XKE.

2. **Freedom of choice**

- You are free to use your session in your own way. Nothing is required, anything goes!
- There is no such thing as a mandatory session. Pick the sessions you want to attend at your own discretion.
- There are no closed sessions. Anyone is free to attend your session.
- A series of sessions (across multiple XKEs) is always open to join midway.

3. **The XKE event schedule is always full**

- There should be at least 5 sessions each hour from 16:00 - 21:00, with dinner at 18:00.
- Together we make sure there are interesting sessions to attend!

4. **Participation in the XKE is mandatory**

- You're expected to reserve time in your agenda for the XKE!
- Arrive on time. Nobody likes latecomers.
- The XKE ends at 21:00. People hosting a late session will appreciate your attendance.-----

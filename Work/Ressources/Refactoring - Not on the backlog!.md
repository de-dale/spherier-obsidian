> A **big refactoring session** is hard to sell, and if sold, it returns less than we hoped, after a long delay.
> 
> On next feature instead of detouring around all the weeds and bushes, we take the time to clear a path through some of them.  
> Maybe this feature takes a little bit longer. Often it doesn't.  
> We start to **get a benefit** from the incremental refactoring **right away**.
> 
> Had we waited to do it in a big batch, we'd have **put in more effort**, delayed any benefits until later still, and likely **wasted effort** on places that **don't provide benefit** yet.
> 
> Work goes better, the code gets cleaner, and we deliver more features than we were able to before. Every one wins.

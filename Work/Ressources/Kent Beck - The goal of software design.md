---
> The goal of software design is to create chunks or slices that fit into a human mind. The software keeps growing but the human mind maxes out, so we have to keep chunking and slicing differently if we want to keep making changes.
> 
> This implies that software design is a human process with technical support, done by humans for humans. As shiny as the technical support is it took me a while to acknowledge that messy people stuff.
> 
> I’ll add that “fits into” and “maxes out” are metaphors and not precisely true, but they help make sense of a healthy, growing urge to re-design. Knowledge is not a quantity & the brain is not a space & we work together.

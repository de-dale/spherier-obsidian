> Many ppl don't seem to understand TDD. It's a design/dev process that results in the simplest possible code. The tests are a nice side effect, but aren't a complete test suite. TDD is a means of achieving simplicity. Remember, it's part of XP, where simplicity is a core value. 1/
> 
> In TDD, you start with an example of how you expect the code will be used. You then implement exactly enough to get that example to work—no more. That example is a test that will be part of a larger test suite. The point is not to create tests, tho, it's to create code. 2/2

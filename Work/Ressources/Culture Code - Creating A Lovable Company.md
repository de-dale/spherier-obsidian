> **Culture : ensemble de croyances, de valeurs et de pratiques.**

When is the best time to think about your team culture or organizational culture? The answer is of course: now. No matter whether your team hasn’t formally started yet, or has been around for several years, organizational culture eats everything for breakfast. It’s best to get a firm grip on how it evolves! With this practice, you collect stories that emphasize your culture.

A culture code is a living document that is used to inform people about the culture of an organization. HubSpot did it with their HubSpot Culture Code slides. Spotify did it with their Spotify Engineering Culture video. Culture codes usually have multiple contributors, and they are shared publicly on the Internet. How will you define your culture code?

Tip: With the Value Stories practice, you can discuss team values and organizational values based on the stories that you have found.

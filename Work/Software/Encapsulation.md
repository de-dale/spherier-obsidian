En [[Programmation OrientÃ©e Objet]], on parle Ã©galement d'**encapsulation**.

> Bundling of data and operation to be performed on that data into single unit is called as encapsulation.

> Encapsulation in Java can be achieved by including both **variable (data)** and **methods (operations)** which act upon those variables into **single unit** called ***class***.

> Encapsulation is often used to **hide important informations** from outside the world. It is called data hiding. This can be achieved by declaring all important variables as private and providing public setter and getter methods.

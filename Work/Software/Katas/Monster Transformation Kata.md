> MI didn't realise there was still a demand for this sort of thing, but it seems people still appreciate the classics. I still think that in many ways FFL is the best game ever. But then it caught me at a young impressionable age. A look at gamefaqs reveals no-one has supplied a transformation chart yet. (20.04.02) I could do that. (v5 note:) The meat transformations system was always the main hole in my knowledge. Now I finally feel like I understand it. I love progress. I'll be assuming you either know your way around FFL or you're willing to learn for yourself. This isn't a general FAQ.

> 1. Find the group and level information for the monster who's eating meat. (See section 3.)

1. Find the group and level for the monster whose meat you're eating.
    
2. Using the table in section 4, work out what group your new monster will belong to.
    
3. Take whichever is the higher of the two levels (meat or eater.) Look in the monster group your new monster will belong to for a monster at exactly this level. If there's one there, you'll become that monster. End of story.
    
4. Otherwise, look in the group for a monster exactly one level up. If there's one of those, you'll become that monster.
    
5. Otherwise, look one level below, then two below, and so on until you reach the nearest level below that does have a monster in the group.
    
6. If you "hit bottom" without reaching a monster, you just get the lowest-level member in that group. (I don't think this ever actually applies, though.) Now the complicated bit: this doesn't always quite work. Monsters actually have two levels, a party level (which you use in steps i and ii), and a target level (which you use when looking up a new monster in steps iv and onward.) For most monsters, these are the same; for some it doesn't seem to work quite like that. These exceptions are listed below the table in section 3

However, monsters at level 12, such as warrior, don't quite agree with this: warrior (skel, L12) + albatros (bird, L1) should look on L12 for a goblin-type, not find one, look on L13, and find titan. Instead, warrior + albatros -> giant. This means either a) giant and nue have target levels of 11 AND 12, or b) titan and sphinx are actually level 14 and so "out of range" for a warrior. If they are level 14, then all top level monsters are actually level 16 (out of range to titan and sphinx). Either way works, I think, but if top level is 16, there's nothing at level 15. I prefer it as it is. O-BAKE: o-bake has a party level of 2 but a target level of 1. This means that oni + zombie, which should look for a ghost on level 2, doesn't "see" o-bake (because it's at level 1 as a target) and moves up to phantom. But an o-bake still transforms as if from level 2. SHRIMP, CACTUS, MEDUSA: These have a party level of 4, 4 and 5 respectively, but it doesn't seem to be possible to transform into them, ever. This means either they have target levels of 3, 3 and 4 respectively (or less), or they don't have target levels at all; either way, you can't get them. Any combination that leads to their groups is good enough to reach the next highest members. MISTAKES These numbers could be wrong; I'm not perfect, and more importantly, I haven't tested every possible combination in the whole game. (Where do you fight beetles anyway?) I'm especially unhappy about that whole giant/nue thing. If there's a mistake in my system, I do want to know about it, but please try and give me the information to figure out what's wrong; ideally something like "In your system, if monster x eats meat y it should become monster z, but actually it becomes monster q".

4: Group Table.

Read the column that matches your current small pic, and the row that matches the large pic of the monster whose meat you're about to eat. The result is what will be your new group. " - " means the effect "Nothing happened" (not to be confused with changing into the same thing.) This will always happen if you eat the meat of something with the same small pic. (v3.1: table uses three letter abbreviations for all groups. It's still hard to read; people deserve better. If someone can improve on this, please, do.) (v5: I'm restoring the single-letter-for-groups table as well. You decide which works better.)

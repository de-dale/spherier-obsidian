#DevOps
> **Trunk-based development** is the practice of continuously merging code into the trunk and avoiding long-lived feature branches. This practice is considered a complement to continuous integration and has been shown for years to accelerate software delivery velocity.
> 
> The benefits of the practice : 
> **ðŸ”¼ Increased** overall software delivery performance 
> **ðŸ”½ Decreased** amounts of unplanned work 
> **ðŸ”½ Decreased** error-proneness 
> **ðŸ”½ Decreased** change failure rate
>
> This is likely due to the additional practices required to successfully implement Trunk-based development. Teams that do not have rigorously enforced rules around never walking away from a broken trunk or that do not use gated code branches and auto-roll back code that breaks the trunk will certainly experience pain when trying to develop on the trunk
> 
> The presence of trunk-based development shows a positive impact on overall organizational performance.
